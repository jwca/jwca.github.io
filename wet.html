Then reality sets in. Everyone on your JV basketball team isnâ€™t getting a full ride to North Carolina or UCLA. There comes a time when your illustrious high school sports career comes to end. There are no more halftime oranges or road trips on the short yellow bus. Only a select few athletes continue on to the college level, others are left to imagine what could have been.
  From the outside looking in college student-athletes seem to be indulged in a lifestyle similar to the rich and famous.
  It seems that for a college student-athlete just about everything is free, and if you need someone to hold your hand for four years, that can be arranged. Life for a college student-athlete would seem to be easy.</p>
  <p>Jamaicans eat foods that are flavored with spices such as ginger, nutmeg, and allspice (pimento). Allspice, the dried berries of the pimento plant, is native to Jamaica and an important export crop. (This is different from pimiento, the red pepper used to stuff green olives.) Many meals are accompanied by bammy , which is a toasted bread-like wafer made from cassava (or yucca, pronounced YOO-kah).
With the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea surrounding the island, seafood is plentiful in the Jamaican diet. Lobster, shrimp, and fish such as red snapper, tuna, mackerel, and jackfish are in abundance.Popular Jamaican dishes include curry goat, fried dumplings, ackee and saltfish (cod). Jamaican cuisine has been adapted by Irish, African, Indian, British, French, Spanish, and Chinese influences. Jamaican patties and various pastries and breads are also popular as well as fruit beverages and Jamaican rum.</p>
  <h3>Our language</h3>
  <p onmouseover = "makeRed(this)"onmouseout = "makeBlack(this)" style = "text-indent:25px" class = "blackParagraph">  Jamaican Patois, known locally as Patois (Patwa or Patwah) and called Jamaican Creole by linguists, is an English-based creole language with West African influences (a majority of loan words of Akan origin) spoken primarily in Jamaica and among the Jamaican diaspora; it is spoken by the majority of Jamaicans as a native language. Patois developed in the 17th century, when slaves from West and Central Africa were exposed to, learned and nativized the vernacular and dialectal forms of English spoken by the slaveholders: British English, Scots, and Hiberno-English. Jamaican Creole exhibits a gradation between more conservative creole forms that are not significantly mutually intelligible with English, and forms virtually identical to Standard English.</p>
  <h4>Our Music</h4>
  <p>The music of Jamaica includes Jamaican folk music and many popular genres, such as mento, ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub music, dancehall, reggae fusion and related styles. ... British genres such as Lovers rock, jungle music and grime are also influenced by Jamaican music.</p>
