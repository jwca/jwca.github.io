Growing up, hundreds of thousands of young athletes dream of playing college sports. Then reality sets in. Everyone on your JV soccer team isnâ€™t getting a full ride to North Carolina or UCLA. There comes a time when your illustrious high school sports career comes to end. There are no more halftime oranges or road trips on the short yellow bus. Only a select few athletes continue on to the college level, others are left to imagine what could have been.
      From the outside looking in college student-athletes seem to be indulged in a lifestyle similar to the rich and famous.
      It seems that for a college student-athlete just about everything is free, and if you need someone to hold your hand for four years, that can be arranged.</p>
